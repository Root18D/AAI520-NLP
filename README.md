# AAI520-NLP

# Advanced Generative Chatbot Design 
# Project Overview:

Goal: Build a chatbot that can carry out multi-turn conversations, adapt to context, and handle a variety of topics.
Output: A web or app interface where users can converse with the chatbot. 


# Research and Study Phase:
Study generative-based chatbot architectures like Seq2Seq, Transformers, and GPT and deep learning.
Understand the challenges of chatbot design: context management, coherency, handling ambiguous queries, etc.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

You can choose one of the following datasets:
Option 1:
Dataset: Cornell Movie Dialogs CorpusLinks to an external site.
Preprocess data: tokenization, handling different languages (if applicable), and managing context.
Option 2:
Dataset: Stanford Question AnsweringLinks to an external site.
Option 3:
Dataset: Ubuntu Dialogue CorpusLinks to an external site.

# Model Design and Training:
Choose an architecture (e.g., Transformer-based models or deep learning models).
Implement or leverage existing implementations to train the model with the dataset.

# Evaluation:
Implement evaluation metrics.
